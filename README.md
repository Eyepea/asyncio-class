= Using asyncio in Python 3.4

This is a start of a workshop/class in how to develop software with
asyncio in Python 3.4.

Before you begin: install Python 3.4 on your machine (earlier versions
aren't supported). Get it from python.org.

Then load slides.html into your browser. You can move back and forward
by typing left and right on your keyboard; the slide page number is
updated at the end of the URL bar in your browser. Your instructor
will reference these, telling you when to move forward and back, or
jump to a specific page.
